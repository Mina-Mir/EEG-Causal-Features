## Neural Oscillation Discovery for Working Memory Performance

This repository houses MATLAB functions designed for discovering neural oscillations that show causal relationships with working memory performance using EEG data.

In addition to my own implementations, I have integrated code from the following sources:
- [SingleCI Causal Feature Selection](https://gitlab.tuebingen.mpg.de/amastakouri/singleCICausalFeatureSelection)
- [Causal Learner Toolbox](https://github.com/z-dragonl/Causal-Learner)

### Usage

To use these functions, clone the repository and follow the instructions in each module's README file for setup and execution.

### References

If you use these methods in your research, please cite the respective sources appropriately.
